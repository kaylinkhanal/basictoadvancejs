let a=15

//Q1.. Calculate the sum of a and b first, and then multiply the result by 2. Store the final value in the variable.
console.log((a+b)*2);


//Q2.. Calculate the difference between b and a, then divide that result by 5. Store the final value in the variable.
console.log((b-a)/5);


//Q3.. Calculate the product of a and b, then add 100 to that result. Store the final value in the variable.
console.log((a*b)+100);



//Q4.. Calculate the quotient when b is divided by a, then subtract 3 from that result. Store the final value in the variable.
console.log((b/a)-3);


//Q5.. Calculate the remainder when b is divided by a, then multiply that result by 4. Store the final value in the variable.
console.log((b%a)*4);
