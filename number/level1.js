//Simple questions

let a = 10;
let b = 20;
let c = 3;

//Q1. Calculate sum of a and b and store it in variable sum
let sum = a + b;
console.log("Sum", sum);

//Q2. caluclate the power of a to b and store it in variable power
let power = a ** b;
console.log(power);

//Q3. Calculate the remainder when b is divided by a and store it in variable remainder
let remainder = b % a;
console.log("Remainder", remainder);
//Q4. Add 10 to a and store it in variable addTen
let addTen = a + 10;
console.log(addTen);

//Q5. Find the half value of a
let halfValue = a / 2;
console.log(halfValue);

// Q6. Add a and b, then multiply the result by c. Store in variable result1
let result1 = (a + b) * c;
console.log(result1);

// Q7. Calculate a squared plus b squared. Store in variable squares
let squares = a ** 2 + b ** 2;
console.log(squares);

//Q8. Find the average of a, b, and c. Store in variable average
let average = (a + b + c) / 3;
console.log(average);

//Q9. Multiply a and b, then find the remainder when divided by c. Store in variable remValue
remValue = (a * b) % c;
console.log(remvalue);

// Q10. Subtract b from a, and then raise the result to the power of c. Store in variable powerValue
let powerValue = (b - a) ** c;

// Q11. Calculate the sum of a, b, and c, then divide by b. Store in variable result2
let result2 = (a + b + c) / b;
console.log(result2);

// Q12. Find the product of a and c, then subtract b. Store in variable result3
let result3 = a * c - b;
console.log(result3);
