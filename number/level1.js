//Q1. Calculate sum of a and b and store it in variable sum
let sum = a + b

//Q2. caluclate the power of a to b and store it in variable power
let power = a ** b

//Q3. Calculate the remainder when b is divided by a and store it in variable remainder
let remainder = b % a
console.log(remainder);

//Q4. Calculate the difference between b and a and store it in variable difference.
let difference=b-a

//Q5. Calculate the product of a and b and store it in variable product.
let product=a*b

//Q6. Calculate the quotient when b is divided by a and store it in variable quotient.
let quotient=b/a
console.log(quotient);

//Q7.. check if b is divisible by a and a is greater than 10
let  div=(b%a===0 && a>10);
console.log(div);



//Q8. check if  a is greater than 10 or b is greater than 10.
console.log(a>10 || b>10)
